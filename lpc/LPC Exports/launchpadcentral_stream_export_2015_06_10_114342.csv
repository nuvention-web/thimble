This is a large space where multiple business people showcase their artistic creations.

This place was referred to us by a high end fashion consumer to checkout local boutiques and designers.

2015-06-05,Phone Call with Scott Gerlach,"Discussed the mail Scott sent with the feedback to the pricing model in detail&nbsp;Hi, Chacko. Amy and I read your docs separately yesterday and spent some time this evening comparing notes. Here are our takeaways:1. We recommend indicating the incentives that your different customer types value. For instance, you note that independent fashion designers can purchase a premium or standard account. But it's not clear what differentiates them at a high level and how the service would be valued by the customer. Just for comparison, Amy and I ran through a similar exercise for a product that's on our back-burner. Even though we're not very precise here and this was only with a 10-minute discussion - and not held up as a polished example - we feel the value exchange is a bit more apparent or at least that our claims of value for the product are somewhat justified. The value chain legitimizes the claims, even if there's a lot of TBD.ConsumersWe are a free service. In exchange for committing data, users receive understanding and visibility about the costs of what they want.BrandsPlacements/Ads - payment in exchange or surfacing brand creative to desired Tally audience, plus data on that audience and data on audience interaction with brand campaign
Unique value prop is much more interactive/engaging ad unit - a “Pinnable”Pricing is CPM, CPC and “CPP”; potentially Cost Per [Some other interaction unit]Data - premium newsletter subscription for discovering shopping research trends, purchase planning trends and budgeting trends and purchasing behaviorUnique value prop is data about purchase intent unavailable elsewhere; more relevant and targeted than ad network inferred intentRetailers Data - same thing but pivoted for retailers (e.g., rollup at store category level)Bounty - We will sell retailers qualified traffic in exchange for a small traffic bounty and a more significant cut of sales on conversions; the retailer incentive is sales with a very low cost of acquisition2. We had trouble differentiating between the stream section and the model section. I think you can conflate the two as we have above. Alternatively, you could do a very terse stream inventory and then make the value exchange clear in the model section. (If you were given a template or there are other class expectations, we don't want to collide with them.)3. The specific prices you list are hard for us to comprehend. They feel high, but we don't have signposts. In other words, without some rationale or comparisons, we don't know how to give you feedback on the specific prices. But we found ourselves wondering if an aspiring designer would spend hundreds of dollars a year vs. buying the tools and materials she needs to make her wares.4. Also gut feel, because you're not clear on what resources the costs cover ... but the costs seem low. Not sure how many of what kind of people you plan to pay what sort of salary, for instance. Would recommend indicating or at least having as an appendix or a backing tab in a spreadsheet.5. As for customer acquisition, you could estimate - even very roughly - the maximum reachable audience for any given channel, the response rate you think you could achieve in that channel and the conversion rate among those who respond. Below is a tiny fragment from that same hypothetical product discussion I mentioned above. In the interest of time, I'm hitting send without proofing. This is hot off the conversation Amy and I were just having. Hope it's useful. Look forward to discussing.",Make sure we have a clear explaination why designers would pay and will find value to spend the money.

2015-05-22,"In Person Meeting with Masha Titievsky, Independent Fashion Designer, Varyform Design","Tradeshows and boutiques represent a chicken-and-egg problem for a lot of designers in that you have to get into to tradeshows to get into boutiques, and you have to get into boutiques to get into tradeshows. Boutiques usually aren't willing to take a (financial, at the end of the day) risk on new designers.Data points boutique owners and other buyers will care about:Line sheetsPrice points:&nbsp;Wholesale v. retailColorsSizes&nbsp;Simple is better. You need photos for every piece. Lighting must be natural. Colors must be specific.Designers should summarize their collections into one color scheme. Color is the most important thing.Each collection will have mini groups, e.g. ""evening,"" ""sports,"" ""neutral,"" etc. A formal company may have forty different types of pieces within one collection. Designers want cohesive collections, but collections that will also appeal to a wide array of audiences. Thimble should allow designers to segment their collections and consider allowing them to target different buyers based on those segments.Finally, trust is the biggest barrier. A lack of it is the reason it's so hard for new designers to break in. Thimble needs to facilitate honest communication between buyer and designer.","Thimble should create guidelines for image hosting to ensure buyers aren't wasting their time looking at items that don't meet standard specifications (listed in description). Different target groups within each collection allow designers to reach a wide audience while preserving design coherence. Simple is better – fewer colors, fewer types of pieces, fewer groups – because it's easier for the buyer to process.

2015-04-29,Video Chat with Scott Gerlach,"Had an hour long conversation covering the tradeshow, demoing the new website features and talking about customer acquisition. Scott emailed the following email, which sums up the customer acquisition piece.Hi, Chacko and Salil. It’s great to see a live Thimble site and to hear about your experiences releasing the preview product and presenting it at the NUvention Arts trade show. The weightier topics we moved into later in the call today shouldn’t diminish your feelings of accomplishment. Getting a working product out is a huge achievement.After the call, Amy and I discussed some possible contradictions in tone and approach that we may have projected. Let’s remedy that here: We think you need to pivot. The big-picture question is this one from the “Startup Owners Manual”: “Do the customer discovery findings point to a big enough market that’s hungry for the product?” There are some good questions earlier in that same section (starting on Page 260 or so) that might help you decide:
Have you discovered a real need, and does your proposed solution yield an enthusiastic response? This is the “they take it from your hands and play with it” signal that Amy suggested.
Are you seeing word-of-mouth sharing of your concept among the colleagues, friends and families of the people to whom you’ve disclosed it?
Do representative customers rate the severity of the problem you’re solving a 7, 8 or 9 out of 10?
Are there enough customers to support a business in this area … and how many is enough?SOM recommends an early-stage startup in “network effect” products like Thimble should attract 1500-5000 customers from multiple segments to prove market size and addressability. Remember, Thimble must solve problems for at least two audiences: designers of fashion and consumers of fashion designs. You may be able to scale with relatively few of the former (100-500) and much more of the latter (the reminder).SOM also recommends setting targets for usage to prove out customer quality and engagement. How would you drive weekly (or multiple times weekly) usage of Thimble in the short run?In addition, we have our same concerns about how well Thimble fits into the workflow of designers and stylists, as well as the purchase flow of fashion consumers. Does the product have a natural fit so that it may become assimilated easily by the various user archetypes you envision?When we drop back and think through these kinds of questions, we struggle to answer affirmatively for Thimble. That doesn’t mean it’s the end. It may be that you’re at what SOM calls “the end of beginning,” when you’ve fully vetted a hypothesis and need to take decisive action. If you decide that action should be a pivot, we can help with tactics (even guerrilla tactics) for reviewing what you know about your audience and trying new ideas to find the resonant concept.Finally, we recognize that this not the feedback you envisioned receiving. There may be ways forward through the remainder of the NUvention course that do not require a gut-wrenching, late-game product pivot. For example,  if you focus on calculating audience addressability and business scaling for Thimble, you will gain valuable insights about scoping market opportunities (just one of many learnings), even if you determine that Thimble as currently conceived will not scale acceptably.We would love to help you through this time.",Think hard if the lack of enthusiastic response from customers indicates a problem with product-market fit.,Mentor Engagement,,Advisory Board members
2015-04-29,"In Person Meeting with Shruti Kirti, Designer-in-residence, Chicago Fashion Incubator, ShrutiKirti.com Owner","No one does pieces - everybody does collection of pieces for a season. Fashion designers design their collection for a single persona. Buyers buy a collection or signup fashion designer for personas that they need to sell it to or based on a consumer that shops in their store. Persona is a generalization of consumers. Designers dont want to lose their creativity and freedom, but still has to adjust to the demands of the buyers. End consumers are very interested in seeing behind the scene process eg: jcrew pinterest, social media channels. Buyers are not too interested, as they dont have time or they dictate their needs. We will have to convince the buyers to look at a collection based on what consumers are looking at when they make a purchase. Young independent fashion designers are not technophobe - they understand the value of internet, social media and networking. The biggest gap between fashion designers and buyers/users is getting their attention and staying in touch with the designer. Buyers are lesser and more particular and there are a lot of fashion designers. She doesnt want to work with stylists or independent photographers who wants to feature her because she rarely gets something of value in return. The transaction is free marketing, if any. Photographers are interested in fashion designers, as a fashion photoshoot can be used to build their own portfolio. She thinks providing resources - like manufacturer, textile sources, pattern makers, CAD designers etc is a very big value prop. She said she takes a lot of pictures on the phone and upload to instagram. She is not concerned about having a professional photo, especially in the design stages, but once she has a full ine, she wants it to be professionally taken. The lifecycle of a collection is as follows - 6-9 months of designing &nbsp;the collection and then 2-3 months for finding the buyer.&nbsp;",,Customer Interview,,Fashion Buyers - Stores, Boutiques, Other

Consider icons like stacked docs for pictures to show the pictures have more content and stories once clicked.When hovering over the images, there is no information about the designer. Have some way of showing the designer info at this stage because our platform is centered around itMake sure this website is tablet friendly - not by the tradeshow date, but definitely when showing to real users and trying to convert themRe-organize the story pages - Give more prominence to the image in terms of positioningIs there a way we can share individual images to social media channels from within the stories/chapters? Or should we keep the sharing at a story level . To begin with, Scott thinks we should keep it at the story level and then look at how users are using it and then adapt.Make sure Tumblr is added to the social media integration list, in addition to pinterest, twitter, facebook, instagramHide the top navigation bar when users start scrolling through the storiesCopy Amazon review styling for text where the text fades off after a few lines. Do that after one or two lines in the description sectionAllow users to upload in landscape orientation also. Create an additional template for thatDesigner info should tuck under once users starts scrolling through the chaptersAdd invite feature to the platform so that users can invite othersUse CMS modules to integrate it in to the website - like drupal and wordpressMake sure users can upload multiple images while uploadingLPC feedback - The ideas seem to be disconnected.

It is a fashion incubator by SAIC, City of Chicago and other entities interested in keeping fashion talent in the city. He gave us a contact who is currently in the incubator to schedule a meeting with. He said that stylists are usually working with agencies like v.mora, celestine etc and we should look into these agencies to understand the dynamics. He thinks that sounds more like a fashion ecosystem and he pushed us to think about solving the sourcing and marketing challenges faced by fashion designers. He said Makers Row is a dead website and he rarely get responses from them. He even mentioned that international sourcers should also be featured. He also said it might be a good idea to consider this platform as a virtual tradeshow platform. He talked about MAGIC, which is an annual fashion tradeshow in Vegas, which is usually not very affordable to independent fashion designers and simulating the exposure and accesses in tradeshows might be very useful for these people who usually cant afford to make it. He also touched upon fashion forecasters like WGSN, whom stylists in big companies dependent on for predicting next season's fashion. This is a very expensive service and he said if we can make it affordable it might be an attractive aspect. About disrupting workflows in fashion and using digital media and devices, he said that currently students in Columbia college is not using tablets or any other digital medium to sketch, but he thinks this is a weakness and should be integrated into the program. But he did say that none of the software available is still not of quality to be used. He talked about Optitex, which is a fashion PLM software and he has been working on integrating it to the curricula. About the secrecy question, he said there are a few people who might be sensitive to that, but he he is seeing a trend where people are not too concerned about it, especially with the ubiquitous of mobile phones, tablets and internet access.",Think of this platform as something that replaces tradeshows and builds a fashion ecosystem.

So how you dress and accessorize when you go into the store is very important.Typical customer base of NM is affluent females who are very fashion&nbsp;conscious&nbsp;and like to fly in the social circles. She said she rarely sees people who are younger than 40 in the stores.About the changing shopping habits of the Millenials and the younger generations, she feels that its all steming from a kind of entitlement because of the more well supported childhood and adolescence these generations have. Most dont have to work for college and rarely goes through the financial crunch their older generations had to go through which makes them less worried about money and more focused on quality of life.",Personal Stylists are more of a convenience for those who dont care how much they pay for what they wear.,Customer Interview,Customer Segments,

2015-02-26,"Phone Call with Nathan Laffin, VP Brand Trend Design Women’s, JC Penny","Styles are temporary, so always go for macro trends to leap frog seasonalities and other transient trends. Focusing on a single piece to write a story might be too time consuming and temporal. Exposing the process - like an open kitchen concept sounds interesting. Virality is key and it depends on the market channel. Celebrity endorsements are the key to virality nowadays. The ""young"" market you are targeting seems like it is small in size, more expensive(25-33), and edgier in style. The classifications of style in this group can be seen as cheap, highend and loft(sewing myself, cool jacket etc). Fashion trends are forecasted using third party trend forecasting services, buying offices, internal teams. Different markets have different types of trend curves(peak, pre-peak, post-peak). Fashion is a very bi-polar industry with peanuts and elephants. Belk and Dillards come in the lower end of fashion, Intermix in the middle, and Bloomingdales and Barneys at the high end. Focusing on Sustainability is a great idea, but in stores people dont pay more for it. Understand the designer psychology - usually they have the ""prophet on the mountain"" mindset. Many in the industry are concerned about others copying their designs and ideas. So there is a tendency amongst designers which makes them reticent in sharing anything with each other. So trend carefully when you start working on an idea which brings their design story to the forefront.","Identifying the target market is key to talk anything about fashion.

2015-02-01,"Phone Call with Abid Mansoor, Entrepreneur, Apparel buyer/sourcer, Own Company, Walmart, Dubai","Abid worked for Walmart in the ethical sourcing and compliance department and has experience working with Apparel manufacturers in the Middle east, India, Bangladesh etc. He is currently sourcing apparel in bulk from these manufacturers and selling it to retailers in the Middle East and Africa. We thought the manufacturing process is more simplified than what the reality is. This interview helped in understanding the complexities and the possibilities. We will be talking more with local apparel manufacturers to get a deeper insight on how ready-to-wear apparel manufacturing works in US.&nbsp;","Manufacturing apparels internationally is a very complex process and makes sense only once the process involves bulk quantities. There are also logistical issues like ensuring quality of make, sourcing quality materials etc. Finding local manufacturers might be the best option if the designs are unique and low sales volume is expected. Also, focusing on a very specific segment of apparel might be better to launch initially, like casual wear for women, or night wear for kids etc.",Customer Interview,Value Propositions,Designers lack market visibility and could use a platform that gives them that.
2015-01-30,"In Person Meeting with Kendel Woods, Grad Student - Master of Design, Fashion, Body, Garment, The School of the Art Institute of Chicago","Learnt a lot about how a design gets made. Kendel mentioned that this is a long process and takes days or weeks for this to happen. Trust is a big factor in the realtionships. Once a designer finds the right manufacturer, usually they dont divulge the information to a third party.&nbsp;","Most of the design students dont have a clear picture on how to make money using their skills. Most dont have an idea on how to source material and merchandise. Most of the Boutique shops are mostly stylist owned or operated. Designer owned or operated ones are rare. There is an intermediary step between creating designs and creating the end product. This role is usually handled by a tech designer, who creates a tech packet, which is send to the manufacturer.",Customer Interview,Value Propositions,Designers lack market visibility and could use a platform that gives them that.
2015-01-30,"Video Chat with Krystell Barraza, Independent Fashion Designer, Krystell Barraza","It usually takes Krystell less than a week to design clothes, which supports our weekly competition model.","Similar to Elizabeth, Krystell takes photos of her clothes on real people and prefers it that way. Krystell mostly ships by hand since most of her customers are local.",Customer Interview,Customer Relationships,
2015-01-28,"Email with Elizabeth Santoro, Consumer, N/A","She added that 360 views are ideal. Price and accessibility are essential, since she doesn't have a car at college and can't shop as easily.&nbsp;When she shops at the store, she gets the immediate satisfaction of having the product right then, which she prefers to shipping. She prefers name-brands for their reliability, especially when buying online","Elizabeth is usually not browsing when she shops online – she prefers the ""experience"" of doing that in-person. When she shops online, she's looking for a specific item. Also, photographs of designs need to have the designs featured on real people.",Customer Interview,Customer Relationships,

2015-01-27,"Phone Call with Clay Greenshaw, Creative Director of Gameday Video, Jacksonville Jaguars","Clay expressed preferring name brand clothes for reliability as well as reputation, and going to stores for a better fit. He said he would not be any more likely to buy local designers, because they may not be influenced by the current trends as much as someone in NY or LA. He buys clothes as an impulse thing, not a big seasonal spree. He thinks the average person could greatly benefit from an easy personal stylist because he sees a lot of people making poor fashion choices.","Clay gets fashion ideas from Instagram where he follows several male models. He prefers to see clothes in the context of being worn by real people candidly, rather than a picture of a shirt on a person with a white background (like a magazine, or online sometimes). He does not have any major issues with this method because he can see the items work in the picture caption.",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-26,"In Person Meeting with Alex Kain, Student, Northwestern University","Alex talked at length about the particular situations when online shopping is better/worse than shopping at a brick & mortar store. Online shopping offers the ability to see current trends and styles, as well as a much wider selection of clothes. She also pointed out that girls often struggle to put together outfits so the option to buy a preset/suggested grouping of clothes would be attractive. A model that we discussed earlier was the trunkclub style purchase. Alex said this model is attractive because it feels more like a gift and because the mystery of what you are going to recieve is exciting. Perhaps we can incorporate this feature by allowing customers to get limited edition pieces from their favorite designers?","For girls who don't generally purchase clothes online, the two situations when they do purchase online are when they really love an item or when fit doesn't matter (scarves, jewelry).",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-26,"Phone Call with Andrew Shapiro, Sales Account Executive, Guidebook","Enforced what we've heard about name brand image not mattering as much as the reliability it provides. Subscribes to GQ and Esquire but doesn't go look there and buy clothes directly from them. If he does see an outfit he likes, he's confident he can put that together himself through other channels. Doesn't seek to cultivate and upkeep an image but he has one implicitly.","He would do online shopping if it were more personalized than it currently is (emphasized fit).
Had a lot of interest in influence/occasion for styles (i.e. southern, wedding, going to bar).
Thought buying local would be cool for developing a relationship with designers.",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-26,"Phone Call with George Elrod, Shopper, Student, DePaul University","George reiterated the power of simplicity and minimalism, something Luke Zhang also mentioned. George also said when he online shops, he's usually browsing moreso than looking for any specific item. For this reason, it might make sense to allow for search, but also to consider how we might make the clothes browsing seamless. Thirdly, he said graphics are important, and he encouraged us to look into graphic design services that allow people to add their own logos or images onto pre-made fabrics by established companies (like American Apparel).",Independent fashion is about owning one-of-a-kind outfits. Allowing consumers to create their own custom outfits makes sense because it suits that one-of-a-kind idea. Nobody else would have the same outfit. We should allow users to create their own library of outfits and provide a notification system to notify designers when one of their pieces was used in a consumer-compiled outfit.,Customer Interview,Customer Relationships,
2015-01-26,"Phone Call with Rachael Hogan, Implementation Manager, Mattersight, Chicago","The smaller boutique shops in the city(like in Lincoln Park, Bucktown) are a lot of times watering holes for high fashion conscious customers. These are mostly window shopping avenues for regular, more price conscious customers.&nbsp;","Even though Rachael goes to the small Boutique stores in the city, and finds a lot of chothes she likes, she finds it too expensive and rarely buys these brands. The biggest factor that keeps her away from buying from small boutiques is the price and the fact can she can never justify the cost to herself.",Customer Interview,Value Propositions,Users want a way to see items coming from independent fashion designers without the hassle of having to search for these designers.
2015-01-26,"Phone Call with Chris Bultena, Student, University of Wisconsin-Madison","We will see with more interviews whether or not the consumers who already have an avenue for finding these non-name brand clothes would be willing to try out a service like ours.Online shopping is preferred when shipping is free, otherwise it's more expensive than going to the store -- maybe our company could provide that","A large reason people buy from name brands rather than independent is that they know they will have what they want because they've had success in the past. Chris looks for a certain style and doesn't care if it's name brand as long as it has the right look.
Fashion design majors may currently be more conservative in their designs because many have the goal of getting their items adopted by larger brands.
He thinks many who would be inclined to find more independent clothing already have avenues through which they do so (blogs, mags).",Customer Interview,,
2015-01-26,"In Person Meeting with Chloe Padula, Ms., Student","She doesn't have a preference to brand names or independent boutiques. Prefers brand names for ""basics"" and boutiques for more unique pieces i.e. accessories, dress, tops.","- Think about user behavior when shopping carts get too expensive, users have a tendency to drop whole cart (might be problematic with outfits)
- Designers might stop selling to independent boutiques after they have a contract with a larger department store (might take away some of our designer customers)
- Logistics ""I don't want something I bought in the summer to come 3 months later. Anything longer than 3 weeks is not feasible""
- Etsy shipping can take forever (see above)",Customer Interview,,

But he mentioned that he used to shop online when he was in college, but now he has switched to go to store as he is concerned about the fit. He also mentioned that he might not be interested in new indie designer stuff, as his needs are being met by brands he shop, like Banana Republic. He found the idea of a stylist intriguing, because of the convenience it offers, but did mention that he will only consider it if it is not too expensive. He also mentioned that his frequency of going out and partying has decreased and so his need for keeping his wardrobe updated has reduced. He shops mostly formal wear for work now, and that,s why sticking to a well known brand is fine with him.","Main reason why he shops in stores is because he is worried about fit, as he feels that he might have gained/lost weight and wants to make sure that he can adjust his purchase accordingly.",Customer Interview,Value Propositions,Designers lack market visibility and could use a platform that gives them that.
2015-01-24,"Phone Call with Dylan Storey, Writer, Stitch Magazine","Dylan said Instagram is kind of like Listerine as a marketing strategy – it's a good supplement to serious personal marketing but it can't be the core of the brand. He also reaffirmed our idea that Etsy's too busy and too disorganized. Finally, Dylan said we need to help independent designers market themselves as human beings rather than brands – it's the one big advantage indie designers have over names like Abercrombie and H&M – their humanity.","We should help independent designers keep up on trends. Brands can react to style changes in the market much quicker than independent designers can. Additionally, one big problem with e-commerce and social media sites is their business. We should keep it clean, simple and minimalist.",Customer Interview,Customer Relationships,
2015-01-23,"In Person Meeting with Heather Payne, CFO, Dixon Midland Company","Our assumption was that most high end fashion consumers shop well known European brands. Heather shops mostly small boutique high end fashion designers whom she has developed trust in over the years. She shops mostly online, and one of the main reason for shopping online is the easy return policy most of these stores offer. She feels that most men's purchases are done by women, so any product offered specifically for men should be design to be attractive to women, sort of like ToysRUs or BabysRUs are doing business. She provided a number of resources, mainly ladies fashion websites which should be researched while evaluating the ecosystem. Her main concern in a platform based on sales and delivery is the operational complexities involved, like shipping time, customer service, ensuring quality of products etc","Providing the full ecosystem(merchandising, production, logistics support) to an aspiring fashion designer as a service will be the most important differentiation.

2015-01-23,"In Person Meeting with Primus D'Mello, Consulting Manager, PwC","Our assumption was that men didnt care too much about fit. It was more of buy everything in bulk or use his spouse's or girl friends help in getting new clothes. Primus said he does most of his purchases online and returns clothes if it doesnt fit him well. He buys average brands like Levi's, Wrangler etc, but that's because he loves the fit. He feels more well known brands are just marking up the price and doesnt give him additional value. He said he would definitely try out a new designer, if he gets a recommendation from a friend, as that's how most of the change in behaviour happens.",Fit is more important than brand.

2015-01-23,"In Person Meeting with Kabid Choudhury, Senior Manager, PwC","Our hypothesis was that most men are not interested in shopping stuff and most of the time women in their life buys clothes for them. Kabid is very specific in the clothes he gets and wears and he doesnt take any help from his wife to make his choices. He is still not comfortable shopping online, as he mentioned that he needs to feel the clothes before he buys them. He said he is very brand conscious and he has some brands which are his default choice for specific clothes(like pants, shirts etc). He has a very customer facing role, so he always need to make sure he is impeccably dressed. In the near future, he is considering going to a store like Lord and Taylor and start having a personal stylist who will curate and sell high quality stuff just for him. He said he is not concerned about the premium he will have to pay for that. He felt that he is okay with wearing a new designer line which is not famous, as long as it looks good and the price is not astronomically high. This will have to be validated later, as I think this is risky statement which might change once he has to pay money for it.&nbsp;","More young(Age 30-40) professional men are seeking assistance from stylists due to time constraints, disinterest in shopping and also because of more dispensable income.",Customer Interview,Value Propositions,Users want a way to see items coming from independent fashion designers without the hassle of having to search for these designers.

Also a big problem of stock among independent designers. Designers will be willing to collaborate or at least network. On the consumer end, consumers often don't know how to change up their look. Providing some guidance for individual consumers could be innovative.","Important to get consumers to realize that you're investing in something that'll last and have a point of view, rather than just something cheap.
